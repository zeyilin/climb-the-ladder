# 🪜 Climb the Ladder — Player Instructions

> *A darkly comedic 2D pixel-art life-sim about grinding yourself into a husk for a corner office you'll eat sad desk salads in.*

## 🎮 Overview

You play as **Alex Park**, a chronically overachieving individual who climbs the corporate ladder at the cost of essentially everything else. From high school burnout to the C-suite reckoning, you must navigate the relentless demands of your career while your personal life quietly crumbles around you.

The game is a satirical take on the "hedonic treadmill" — each promotion feels good for exactly 4 seconds before the anxiety sets in.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### 1. Time Management

Each day is divided into **Time Slots** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). You must choose how to spend them.

- **Work/Study**: Increases your career stats (GPA, Performance) but increases Burnout.
- **Socialize**: Maintains relationships with friends and family.
- **Rest**: Reduces Burnout but "wastes" a slot (the game will judge you for this).

### 2. The Trade-Off

Every decision is a trade-off. You **cannot** do everything.

- If you study all night, you will miss your friend's party.
- If you go to the party, you might fail the exam.
- If you try to do both, you will burn out.

### 3. Relationships & Decay

Your relationships are represented by portraits in the **Relationship Panel** (`TAB`).

- **Decay**: Relationships naturally decay over time. If you ignore someone, their portrait literally fades to grey.
- **Connection**: Spend time with people to keep the connection alive.
- **Consequences**: If a relationship reaches 0, it is **permanently lost**. They will stop calling.

### 4. Burnout

Your **Burnout Meter** tracks your mental exhaustion.

- **High Burnout**:
  - Dialogue options become "unhinged" (e.g., snapping at your mom).
  - Mini-games become harder (sluggish controls, desaturated colors).
  - You may suffer a "Burnout Event" where you lose control of a time slot.
- **Recovery**: The only way to lower burnout is to **Rest** (or sleep).

### 5. Career Tracks

At the end of Act II (College), the **Economy** decides your career for you via a slot machine.

- **Consulting**: Solving business cases and traveling to Cleveland.
- **Investment Banking**: Spreadsheet puzzles at 3 AM.
- **Startup**: Burning money and pitching to VCs.
- **Big Tech**: Optimizing button colors for weeks.

## 💡 Survival Tips

1. **You Can't Win Everything**: The "perfect" run where you have a maxed-out career and perfect relationships does not exist. Choose what matters to you.
2. **Call Your Mom**: She waits by the phone. Seriously, just call her.
3. **Watch the Airhorn**: If you hear a tiny airhorn, your burnout has peaked. Take a nap.
4. **Read the Flavor Text**: The item descriptions and dialogue choices are where the story lives.
5. **The Ending**: There are multiple endings based on who is left at your dinner table in Act V.

*Good luck. The ladder isn't going to climb itself.*
