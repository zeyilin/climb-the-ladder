# 🪜 Climb the Ladder

> *A darkly comedic 2D pixel-art life-sim about grinding yourself into a husk for a corner office you'll eat sad desk salads in.*

**Climb the Ladder** is a satirical life simulation game where you play as Alex Park, an overachiever who climbs the corporate ladder at the cost of essentially everything else. It plays like *Stardew Valley* meets *Succession*, with a dash of existential dread.

## 🎮 Features

* **5 Distinct Acts**: From high school burnout to the C-suite reckoning.
* **The Career Roulette**: You don't pick your job; the economy picks for you. Will you be in Investment Banking, Tech, or Consulting?
* **Relationship Decay**: Relationships take work. If you ignore your mom's calls to close a deal, she stops calling.
* **Mini-Game Grind**: Perform tasks like "Spreadsheet Sprint" and "Pitch Perfect" that feel fun until they feel like work.
* **The Trade-Off Wheel**: Every hour spent working is an hour not spent living. Choose wisely.
